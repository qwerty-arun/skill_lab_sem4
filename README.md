# Summary on Skill-lab session from 8/7/24 to 13/7/24 on "Basics of VLSI design and Cadence Software"
<details>
  <summary>Day1</summary>
<details>
  <summary>Session-1</summary>
  1) Addition, multiplication and shift are three basic operations in any basic VLSI design. </br>
  2) PMOS and NMOS introduction. </br>
  3) Inverter design using PMOS and NMOS.</br>
  4) Carry Look Ahead Adder truth table.</br>
  5) Voltage transfer characteristics and transient analysis.</br>
  6) AND = NAND and then connected to NOT gate is correct but NAND = AND and then connected to NOT gate is completely wrong.</br>

<summary>Session-2 and 3</summary>
  1) CMOS implementation on Cadence Software on linux (ubuntu).</br>
  2) We log in to network page using ssh keys and ip address. Enter password and then type `csh` and 'source cshrc_617'. Shift to appropriate directory and then type 'virtuoso &'.</br>
  3) Tutorials on youtube are available.

  <summary>Day2</summary>
<details>
  <summary>Session-1</summary>
  1) Some server errors, how to get to know the status of a server? How to ping it?</br>
  2) CMOS inverter on Cadence software.</br>
  3) https://youtu.be/64c4djOzam8?feature=shared
</details>
  <details>
  <summary>Session-2 and 3</summary>
  1) Full adder realization using CMOS technology.</br>
  2) Realizing the circuit and how many transistors are required.</br>
  3) How do you reduce the number of transistors? From the truth table, find something which is common, you can remove redundancy.</br>
  4) In total, 38 transistors are required to realise the 1 bit full adder. </br>
